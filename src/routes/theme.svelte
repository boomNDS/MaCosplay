  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Hello, I'm IdeaRC!</h1>
  <p class="text-lg text-center mb-4">
    I build games, create AI startups, and I'm an enthusiast of space astrophysics and rocket science. I also enjoy anime and cosplay as my favorite hobby. This is my personal website blog post where I share my aspirations, goals, and what I learn along the way.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-center mb-4">
    I often ponder whether humans universally strive for status, acceptance, validation, and freedom, yet I constantly seek to understand what lies beyond these desires and uncover the true meaning of life.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Journey</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    My journey into the world of game development began when I was 17. I started creating an anime-style MOBA fighting game using Unreal Engine, and my dedication to the craft quickly led me to participate in the Chainlink Fall 2021 Blockchain Hackathon. I was thrilled to win $1,300 for my top-quality project, @AlchemistWar, which has since generated the same amount in revenue. Back in high school, I founded a laser tag project using Microbit for school science days, and it was a huge hit – over 500 people played during the event. This early project fueled my passion for creating engaging and interactive experiences.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Beyond game development, I've ventured into the AI space with my project, Celestiai.co, an AI voice platform that has gained 5,000 users here in Thailand. As a solopreneur, I've built complex systems like multiplayer game mechanics and animations in Unreal Engine, and full-stack websites using modern tech stacks like SvelteKit, PocketBase, and Skeleton UI.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Let's Connect!</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    As a 19-year-old otaku, I'm now seeking collaborators for exciting projects. I'm open to remote part-time positions and eager to connect with those who share my passion for tech, otaku culture, cosplay, and Hoyoverse games. I'm also developing OtakuSpace, a community where otaku entrepreneurs come together to create innovative projects and build cool stuff. Additionally, through SaaS Thailand, I'm fostering a community for building SaaS startups, sharing ideas at events and through online platforms.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Additionally, I'm fascinated by the idea of developing an AI VTuber assistant. With my diverse skill set and a track record of successful projects, I'm excited about the future and the potential to make a significant impact in the game development and AI industries. Let's connect and see what amazing things we can create together!
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Power of Focus</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I truly believe in the power of focusing on a single thing at a time, like a magnifying glass can create incredibly unexpected results.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Life is Like a Movie</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    So, how will your life’s movie look? What will inspire others when they watch it? Remember, you don't need a perfect script to create something beautiful. Even mistakes and failures are part of the story that makes it authentic and meaningful.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Start creating the story of your dreams. Be bold, take risks, and make the plot uniquely yours. After all, the best movies are the ones that leave a lasting impact on the audience—and in this case, the audience is the world.
