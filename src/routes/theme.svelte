	<h1 class="mb-6 text-center text-4xl font-bold">Hello, I'm IdeaRC!</h1>
	<p class="mb-4 text-center text-lg">
		I build games, create AI startups, and I'm an enthusiast of space astrophysics and rocket
		science. I also enjoy anime and cosplay as my favorite hobby. This is my personal website blog
		post where I share my aspirations, goals, and what I learn along the way.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4 text-center text-lg">
		I often ponder whether humans universally strive for status, acceptance, validation, and
		freedom, yet I constantly seek to understand what lies beyond these desires and uncover the true
		meaning of life.

	<h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">My Journey</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		My journey into the world of game development began when I was 17. I started creating an
		anime-style MOBA fighting game using Unreal Engine, and my dedication to the craft quickly led
		me to participate in the Chainlink Fall 2021 Blockchain Hackathon. I was thrilled to win $1,300
		for my top-quality project, @AlchemistWar, which has since generated the same amount in revenue.
		Back in high school, I founded a laser tag project using Microbit for school science days, and
		it was a huge hit – over 500 people played during the event. This early project fueled my
		passion for creating engaging and interactive experiences.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Beyond game development, I've ventured into the AI space with my project, Celestiai.co, an AI
		voice platform that has gained 5,000 users here in Thailand. As a solopreneur, I've built
		complex systems like multiplayer game mechanics and animations in Unreal Engine, and full-stack
		websites using modern tech stacks like SvelteKit, PocketBase, and Skeleton UI.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Let's Connect!</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		As a 19-year-old otaku, I'm now seeking collaborators for exciting projects. I'm open to remote
		part-time positions and eager to connect with those who share my passion for tech, otaku
		culture, cosplay, and Hoyoverse games. I'm also developing OtakuSpace, a community where otaku
		entrepreneurs come together to create innovative projects and build cool stuff. Additionally,
		through SaaS Thailand, I'm fostering a community for building SaaS startups, sharing ideas at
		events and through online platforms.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Additionally, I'm fascinated by the idea of developing an AI VTuber assistant. With my diverse
		skill set and a track record of successful projects, I'm excited about the future and the
		potential to make a significant impact in the game development and AI industries. Let's connect
		and see what amazing things we can create together!
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Power of Focus</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		I truly believe in the power of focusing on a single thing at a time, like a magnifying glass
		can create incredibly unexpected results.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Life is Like a Movie</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		So, how will your life’s movie look? What will inspire others when they watch it? Remember, you
		don't need a perfect script to create something beautiful. Even mistakes and failures are part
		of the story that makes it authentic and meaningful.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Start creating the story of your dreams. Be bold, take risks, and make the plot uniquely yours.
		After all, the best movies are the ones that leave a lasting impact on the audience—and in this
		case, the audience is the world.
